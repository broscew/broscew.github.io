## Role Description
**"Through the Shadows"** was a Freshman Game Project created by Team Dabs. It was created using Digipen's proprietary engine, Alpha Engine. All of the engine architecture is developed using C++.

My job was to link and create character movement using the A Star pathfinding developed by my teammate to the ECS.

I worked on the undo and redo system that keeps track of every action the player made from start to end. Next, I was in charged of developing and implementing a particle effects system.

My last tasked for this project was to work on a simple serialization for the saving of levels.
